# NRC Local Corpus E2E Runbook

## Purpose
This proof runner exercises the live NRC ADAMS APS route chain against the local 43-PDF corpus under `data_demo/nrc_adams_documents_for_testing` inside a fresh isolated runtime. It is a verification surface, not a new operator lane.

## Invocation
Run it directly with the repo-local Phase 7A interpreter:

```powershell
C:\Users\benny\OneDrive\Desktop\project6_REPO_MCP_FOLDER\.venvs\phase7a-py311\Scripts\python.exe `
  C:\Users\benny\OneDrive\Desktop\project6_REPO_MCP_FOLDER\tools\run_nrc_aps_local_corpus_e2e.py
```

Optional:

```powershell
C:\Users\benny\OneDrive\Desktop\project6_REPO_MCP_FOLDER\.venvs\phase7a-py311\Scripts\python.exe `
  C:\Users\benny\OneDrive\Desktop\project6_REPO_MCP_FOLDER\tools\run_nrc_aps_local_corpus_e2e.py `
  --runtime-root C:\Users\benny\OneDrive\Desktop\project6_REPO_MCP_FOLDER\backend\app\storage_test_runtime\lc_e2e\<empty_dir>
```

## What The Tool Does
- Fails closed unless the corpus root, folder counts, PDF total, Phase 7A interpreter, `fitz`/`camelot`/`paddleocr`, Paddle model dirs, and Ghostscript all check out.
- Assumes that `.venvs\phase7a-py311` is aligned with [backend/requirements.txt](C:\Users\benny\OneDrive\Desktop\project6_REPO_MCP_FOLDER\backend\requirements.txt). If that interpreter drifts, real app import surfaces like FastAPI form handling or analysis-module imports will fail before the NRC proof can start.
- Creates a fresh isolated runtime under `backend/app/storage_test_runtime/lc_e2e/...` with its own SQLite DB and `STORAGE_DIR`.
- Raises `CONNECTOR_LEASE_TTL_SECONDS` to `1800` inside that isolated runtime so the largest local-corpus OCR/table targets do not self-expire the connector lease mid-proof.
- Boots the live FastAPI app in-process with `TestClient`.
- Monkeypatches the NRC ADAMS client only inside the proof process so the live `/runs` path pages across the local corpus instead of the external API.
- Submits one strict NRC APS run, waits for completion, runs search smoke, persists the downstream chain through deterministic challenge review packet, then executes the validate-only gates against the isolated runtime.
- Writes `local_corpus_e2e_summary.json` into the runtime root and leaves the runtime intact on both pass and fail.

## Success Criteria
- 43 PDFs discovered, selected, and downloaded.
- Zero failed targets.
- Persisted downstream chain reaches deterministic challenge review packet.
- At least one persisted OCR-derived file and at least one persisted table-bearing file are observed from the generated artifacts.
- All validate-only gates pass against the isolated runtime.

## Non-Goals
- No `project6.ps1` wrapper is added here. That script is still bound to `py -3.12`, while this proof must run in `.venvs/phase7a-py311`.
- No API/schema/DB contract changes.
- No mutation of `tests/reports/*.json`, `backend/method_aware.db`, `backend/app/storage`, or the historical `run_20260314_010136` evidence package.

## Notes
- The proof intentionally maps `technical_specification_amendment_documents_for_testing` to `Technical Specification Amendment` so the live advanced-table routing path is exercised. The current `document_types.json` vocabulary still uses `Technical Specification, Amendment`; the summary records that mismatch as observed tech debt instead of changing repo contracts here.
- The live submit route assigns `connector_run_id` server-side, so the tool uses a runtime-stamp-derived `Idempotency-Key`. It does not modify the API just to force a caller-chosen run ID.
- The lease TTL override is proof-local only. It is applied through the isolated runtime environment, not by changing shared repo defaults or the `project6.ps1` operator surface.
